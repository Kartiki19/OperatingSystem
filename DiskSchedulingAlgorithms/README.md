# Assignment 4 :  
Implement 3 different algorithms for scheduling the arm on a hard disk. 
1. First Come-First Serve (FCFS), 
2. Shortest Seek First (SSF) and 
3. Elevator (SCAN) algorithms

Simulate the motion of the disk arm by taking a set of requests for cylinders/tracks to read and then determining the order in which they will be read. Report the total distance (number of cylinders) the disk arm had to traverse in the three algorithms using the same set of random numbers.

# Execution :
1. To run the algorithm, use following commands : 
    i. make
    ii. ./DiskSchedulingAlgorithm
2. To remove executable run : make clean

# Results :
1. Check the Output.png for results
