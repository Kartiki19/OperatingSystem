 **Steps To Execute**
 -----------------------------------------------
    1. Open the folder and run make file using command : make
    2. It will create an executable file "prodcon"
    3. Execute file using command : ./prodcon <NoOfConsumerThreads> <MaxNumberToBeGenerated>
    4. Example : ./prodcon 3 6
    5. Here, the second argument <MaxNumberToBeGenerated> should be greater than 5, as the buffer size is 5 and to test circular buffer, number of inputs should be greater than 5
    6. If you executed only by running "./prodcon" (without any arguments) file. Then it will take following values as default :
        a. num_consumers = 2; /// Specify on cmd line; default is two. 
        b. max_number = 10; /// Specify on cmd line; default is ten
   
**Results**
--------------
    1. Above execution will result in :

    kartikidindorkar@Kartikis-MacBook-Pro % make

    g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -pthread -c -o prodcon.o prodcon.cpp
    g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -pthread -o prodcon prodcon.o

    kartikidindorkar@Kartikis-MacBook-Pro % ./prodcon 3 6

    Producer wrote 0
    Producer wrote 1
    Consumer 1809510400, read 0
    Consumer 1809510400, read 1
    Producer wrote 2
    Consumer 1810083840, read 2
    Producer wrote 3
    Consumer 1809510400, read 3
    Producer wrote 4
    Consumer 1810083840, read 4
    Producer wrote 5
    Consumer 1810657280, read 5

    2. Here, the producer thread will generate 6 numbers (as per the 2nd argument passed through cmd line) 0 to 5.
    3. producer thread will write these numbers onto circular buffer.
    4. Consumer Threads will read these numbers and print them onto the cosnole.
    5. To re-compile the file first run : make clean (to remove all the executables generated by previous make)
    6. Please refer following images from the folder for outputs :
        a. Output_1 : Running the program using make and arguments
        b. Output_default : Executing the program using previously generated executable and without any arguments (default arguments will be taken as 2 & 10)
        c. Output_makeClean : Use of make clean to delete previous executable and run again
